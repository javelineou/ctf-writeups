At first I noticed the binary seperated with spaces. I simply took the first four binary, remove the whitespaces and convert into ASCII characters, and the result is 'last' <br>
So I thought I was done because the flag format is 'lastctf'. I'll just have to make a code and loop through it and convert into characters. <br>
In the middle of working on the code, I find this too easy and I feel there is another way with this problem. Then researched a bit until I found a whitespace esoteric language.
