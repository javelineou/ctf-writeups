Title: Juggling Clown <br>
Type: strcmp() vulnerability <br>
Target: skrctf.me <br><br>

Given a website and its source code <br>

It is pretty straightforward, the system uses a simple strcmp between our GET request and the $answer variable. <br>

After a bit research, it seemed that strcmp had some issues when comparing a string to something else. <br>

If I set $_GET[‘answer’] equal to an empty array, then strcmp would return a NULL. Due to some inherent weaknesses in PHP’s comparisons, NULL == 0 will return true. More info: http://www.dimuthu.org/blog/2008/10/31/triple-equal-operator-and-null-in-php/

With this in mind, I sent the following request to the page <br>
