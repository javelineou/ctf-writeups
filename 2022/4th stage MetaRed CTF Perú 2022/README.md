#  4th stage MetaRed CTF PerÃº 2022 Write Up
This isn't a full write up. Only the challenge I remember since they close the CTF site and didn't share it to public.

## > Take my key
Suppose users Alice and Bob enter into a key agreement with p = 101 and g = 17. Suppose. Alice chooses x = 19 and Bob chooses y = 13. Determine the key they will share.

## > Variables and more variables
Considere un sistema RSA con p=7, q= 11 and = e=13, encuentre el texto plano correspondiente a c=17.

## > Beautiful place to visit in Peru
Do you know the beautiful places that Peru has? I'll give you some clues so you can discover them. A file has been transferred with the list of some interesting places in Peru that you should know. Find out which place we recommend you visit.
Locate a clue that will lead you to discover the chosen place

### Steps
Given a .pcapng file, we can open it using Wireshark. First, we open the hierarchy protocol statistics to see the protocol summaries.

There are 2 interesting protocols here which is HTTP and FTP. After looking through the packets, there is an interesting files in the FTP packets (turismo.zip and a .txt file). Seems like the user uploaded files since there is a ``STOR`` command. We can try to extract the FTP-data by following the TCP stream > show raw -> save as.

Now we have a protected zip file. Turns out the .txt file is actually the password. So now we can open the zip and the flag is shown.

## > Popular Peruvian food
Another .pcapng forensic challenge. Similar like before, but instead the it is TELNET packets (which is insecure since it transfers the data in plaintext).
